Verbena bonariensis better known as Tall Verbena could be described as long-blooming lilac flowers bundled in a group. Originating from South America, the stupendous perennial has 6-feet-tall svelte stems and ovate leaves with a toothed margin. The enchanting flowers usually bloom in the mid-summer.
It’s pretty significant to determine the medium to grow the Verbena. It requires soil which is mostly well-drained and partial shade. To maintain the regular humidity, watering the plant twice a day is definitely great. Unfortunately, it’s prone to powdery mildew and slug attack

	The grass is a plant having narrow leaves that grow from the base. Grass gets water from its roots in the ground. A common type of grass is used for covering the ground in a lawn and other places. It is a very common plant and can be found very easily grown in a number of areas. It prevents erosion by water and wind, adds visual appeal and helps in breaking down organic chemicals.
	Clouds are a mass of water droplets or ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere. They are created when the evaporated water vapour (from water bodies) turns into liquid water droplets. These tiny water droplets are formed on minute particles such as dust floating in the air.
